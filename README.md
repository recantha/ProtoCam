ProtoCam
========

The ProtoCam is a prototyping board developed by [Richard Saville](http://averagemanvsraspberrypi.com) and is currently being funded through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/955730101/protocam-the-raspberry-pi-camera-module-prototypin).
If you want something to build a circuit and mount a Pi camera, I can thoroughly recommend it!

The script isn't fancy, all it does is read a button press and then:
* lights the 4 LEDs up
* uses the picamera library to initiate the taking of a photograph

Here's a picture of the project. Excuse the rather crude nature of it - I wanted to show the circuit that I used. If I was doing it again, I would of course solder everything onto the underside to keep things nice and tidy!
