ProtoCam
========

The ProtoCam is a prototyping board developed by [Richard Saville](http://averagemanvsraspberrypi.com) and funded through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/955730101/protocam-the-raspberry-pi-camera-module-prototypin).

The script isn't fancy, all it does is read a button press and then:
* lights the 4 LEDs up
* uses the picamera library to initiate the taking of a photograph
